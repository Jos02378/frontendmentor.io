## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a how to use a property called 'flex'. I use it to create the 2 columns for the accordion and the image. I also learned how to create an accordion and how to hide the text using the height property.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.container--image {
    flex: 1;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    min-height: 450px;
    align-items: center;
}

.container--text {
    flex: 1;
}
```
